The Abstract:
--------------
The mechanism of assembly of lipoprotein particles in the lumen of the
endoplasmic reticulum is an important but poorly understood biological problem.
A knowledge of this process is of great practical importance because possession
of elevated levels of lipoproteins is one of the major risk factors for the
development of atherosclerosis. This review describes a major advance in the
delineation of the mechanisms involved in the assembly and secretion of
apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins: the demonstration of a requirement for
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.


The Anaphora in the Abstract in Appearance Order

 the development -> possession

 This review -> a major advance
 the delineation -> secretion
 the mechanisms -> lipoproteins
 the assembly -> secretion
 the demonstration -> a requirement

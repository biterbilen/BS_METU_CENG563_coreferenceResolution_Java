The Abstract:
--------------
Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is an emerging paradigm in signal
transduction. RIP is mediated by intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CliPs),
which liberate biologically active nuclear or secreted domains from their
membrane-tethered precursor proteins. The yeast Pcp1p/Rbd1p protein is a
Rhomboid-like I-CliP that regulates mitochondrial membrane remodeling and fusion
through cleavage of Mgm1p, a regulator of these essential activities. Although
this ancient function is conserved in PARL, the mammalian ortholog of
Pcp1p/Rbd1p, the two proteins show a strong divergence at their N-terminus.
However, the N-terminus of PARL is significantly conserved among vertebrates,
particularly among mammals, suggesting that this domain evolved a distinct,
still unknown function. Here, we show that the cytosolic N-terminal domain of
PARL is cleaved at positions 52-53 (alpha-site) and 77-78 (beta-site). While
alpha-cleavage is constitutive and removes the mitochondrial targeting sequence,
beta-cleavage appears to be developmentally controlled and dependent on PARL
I-CliP activity in trans. The beta-cleavage of PARL liberates P-beta, a
nuclear-targeted peptide whose sequence is conserved only in mammals. Thus, in
addition to its evolutionarily conserved function in regulating mitochondrial
dynamics, PARL might mediate a mammalian-specific, developmentally regulated
mitochondria-to-nuclei signaling through regulated proteolysis of its N-terminus
and release of the P-beta peptide.

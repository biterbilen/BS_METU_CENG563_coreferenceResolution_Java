The Abstract:
--------------
The structural complexity of chloroplasts is reflected in their intriguing
protein-targeting system. Not only must nucleus-encoded proteins be targeted to
the chloroplast, but also, once inside the chloroplast, these polypeptides must
be directed to their final destination in one of six intrachloroplastic
compartments. Although the details of this process remain elusive, many recent
advances have improved our vantage point for examining this system.

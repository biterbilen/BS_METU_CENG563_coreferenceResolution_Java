The Abstract:
--------------
Most cells process proteins into short peptides that are displayed on the cell
surface bound to class I or class II proteins encoded by the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC). These protein-peptide complexes can then be
recognized by the circulating lymphocytes of the immune system. Several genes
found recently in the MHC encode proteins with possible roles in the supply of
peptides to class I molecules. The results imply that the peptides are produced
in the cytoplasm by proteasomes and are translocated into the endoplasmic
reticulum by 'peptide transporters' related to the multidrug resistance
proteins. While there is little biochemical evidence to validate these ideas,
Robert DeMars and Thomas Spies discuss here the arguments supporting this view.
New data indicate that there may also be factors for class II peptide-processing
hidden in the MHC.

The Abstract:
--------------
The TP73 gene encodes a nuclear protein that has high homology with TP53. TP73
is rarely mutated in human cancer. The presence of a 1-kb regulatory fragment
within the first intron of TP73 was recently reported. This fragment exerts
silencer activity on TP73 mediated by ZEB. We searched for possible mutations in
this negative regulatory region in 45 colorectal and 43 breast cancer patients
and in 34 healthy donors. The study was carried out using the SSCP method, and
the allelic variants detected were sequenced. The expression of TP73 was
analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was assessed
by microsatellite study. In several samples, we identified an allele variant
that corresponds to a deletion of 73 bp in tumor tissues and normal
counterparts, localized between -489 and -417 from the ATG start site of exon 2.
Among the 88 tumor samples, 35 (40%) showed at least 1 allele with the cited
deletion, versus 7 of the 34 (21%) healthy donors (P = 0.045). When we
classified the patients according to the number of variations into homozygous or
heterozygous groups, the significance was clearer (P = 0.03). No LOH was
detected in the heterozygous cases. There was a positive quantitative
correlation between the expression of TP73 and the presence of the allelic
variant (P = 0.029). These data suggest that this allelic variant is common in
breast and colorectal cancers and that it could alter the expression of the TP73
gene with an additive effect.

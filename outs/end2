The Abstract:
--------------
Secretory proteins and integral membrane proteins travel through the secretory
pathway to a variety of destinations. Their targets are often specified by
signals in the amino acid sequence or signals added post-translationally. The
KDEL sequence that retains soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and the
mannose 6-phosphate group of lysosomal enzymes are well-characterized examples
of targeting signals; other signals are less well understood. Given the
complexity and importance of the intracellular trafficking pathways, it is
perhaps not surprising that mutations that affect the trafficking of proteins
are associated with some human genetic diseases.

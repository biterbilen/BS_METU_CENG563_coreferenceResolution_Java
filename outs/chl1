The Abstract:
--------------
Nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are imported from the cytosol into the
chloroplast stroma by a common translocation machinery. Several components of
the import apparatus, including GTP-binding proteins and Hsp70 proteins, have
recently been identified and characterized. This review discusses the role of
these proteins in chloroplast protein import.

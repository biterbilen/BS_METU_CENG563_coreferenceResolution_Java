The Abstract:
--------------
Leukocyte elastase (LE) degrades connective tissue, is involved in the
inflammatory process and implicated in cyclic and congenital neutropenia. The
human LE gene is within a serine proteinase locus on chromosome 19 pter13.3. Our
observations demonstrate that LE gene expression is regulated by PU.1, a
cytidine-rich and a Myb binding site. The LE promoter has two cytidine-rich
sites at -158 and -185. The -158 is the active site and it is closest to the
PU.1 site. Proximity is essential to activity since separation of the -158 and
PU.1 sites by a 20-base pair oligonucleotide reduced promoter activity by 50%.
This suggests physical interaction between the transcription proteins binding to
the PU.1 and -158 sites. The nuclear protein that binds the -158 site is present
in B and T lymphocytes and an erythroleukemia cell line in addition to being
abundant in the promyelocytic stage of neutrophil maturation when the LE gene is
expressed. The protein binding to the -158 site is absent or expressed at low
levels in non-hematopoietic cell lines. We have identified the transcription
factors essential for human LE gene expression. Comparison with the mouse LE
gene shows similarities and differences.

The Abstract:
--------------
Balbiani rings are exceptionally large puffs on the polytene chromosomes in the
dipteran Chironomus tentans. These puffs are particularly well suited for
studies of the structure of active genes and the synthesis and transport of
specific RNA-protein (RNP) particles. The Balbiani ring RNP particle consists of
a ribbon bent into a ring-like structure, the ribbon being built from a tightly
folded 7 nm RNP filament. The assembly of the particle takes place concomitant
with transcription and occurs in a stepwise fashion. As the particle is
transported through the nuclear pore the ribbon straightens out, with the 5' end
of the transcript leading. During translocation the tightly packed RNP filament
is gradually unfolded, and on the cytoplasmic side the mRNA is immediately
engaged in polysome formation.

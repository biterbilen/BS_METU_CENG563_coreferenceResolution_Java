The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family of cytoplasmic
serine/threonine protein kinases is activated by a wide range of extracellular
stimuli. In this review we focus on the accumulating evidence that proteins
encoded by proto-oncogenes and oncogenes are either involved in the regulation
of the MAP kinase pathway or are its targets.

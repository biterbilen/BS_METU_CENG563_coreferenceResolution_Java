Alzheimers disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
extracellular deposition of -amyloid (A) peptide containing neuritic plaques. A
peptides are proteolytically derived from the membrane bound amyloid precursor
protein (APP). Although the function of APP is not entirely clear, previous
studies demonstrate that neuronal APP co-localizes with 1 integrin receptors at
sites of focal adhesion suggesting that APP is involved in mediating neuronal
process adhesion. Integrin-dependent adhesion is also a well-characterized
component of immune cell proinflammatory activation. Using primary mouse
microglia and the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, we have begun investigating
the role of APP in integrin-dependent activation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies
demonstrate that APP is recruited into a multi-receptor signaling complex during
1 integrin-mediated adhesion of monocytes. Stimulation induces a subsequent,
specific recruitment of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to APP including Lyn
and Syk. Antibody cross-linking of cell surface APP leads to a similar response
characterized by activation and recruitment of tyrosine kinases to APP as well
as subsequent activation of MAP kinases and increased proinflammatory protein
levels. These data demonstrate that APP can act as a proinflammatory receptor in
monocytic lineage cells and provide insight into the contribution of this
protein to the inflammatory conditions described in Alzheimers disease.
